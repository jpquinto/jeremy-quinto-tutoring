# Basic Sine and Cosine Curves: Practice Problems

### 1: Graphing Sine and Cosine
First, start by graphing sine and cosine. You should be able to graph these from memory!


### 2: Properties of Sine and Cosine Functions
For both the sine and cosine functions, answer the following questions:
- What is the domain?
- What is the range?
- What is the period of the function?
- What are the $x$-intercepts?
- What are the $y$-intercepts?
- Is it odd or even?
- What are the line(s) of symmetry for the graph?

### 3: Period of Sine and Cosine Functions
Remember that:

If $b$ is a positive, real number, then the **period** of
$y=a \sin bx$ and $y=a \cos bx$
is given by:
$$Period=\frac{2\pi}{b}$$

Knowing this, find the PERIOD of the following:
- $y=7\sin(10x)$
- $y=2\cos(16x)$
- $y=\sin(3x)$

Now, graph the three functions above, given that you now know the periods for each.

### 4: Describing the Relationship Between Graphs
For the following, describe the relationship between the graphs of $f$ and $g$. Consider amplitudes, periods, and shifts.

#### a
$f(x)=\sin x$
$g(x)=\sin(x-\pi)$

#### b
$f(x)=\cos 2x$
$g(x)=-\cos 2x$

#### c
$f(x)=\cos 2x$
$g(x)=3+\cos 2x$

#### d
$f(x)=\sin 3x$
$g(x)=\sin(-3x)$

#### e
$f(x)=\sin x$
$g(x)=-\frac{1}{2} \sin x$

#### f
$f(x)=\cos 4x$
$g(x)=-2+\cos 4x$

### 5: Sketching the Graphs of Sine or Cosine Functions
For the following, sketch the graphs of $f$ and $g$ in the same coordinate plane. Include two full periods.

#### a
$f(x)=\sin x$
$g(x)=-4 \sin x$

#### b
$f(x)= \cos \pi x$
$g(x)=1 + \cos \pi x$

#### c
$f(x)=-\frac{1}{2} \sin \frac{x}{2}$
$g(x)=2 \sin(\frac{x}{4})$

### 6: Tangent Function
For both the **tangent**, answer the following questions:
- What is the domain?
- What is the range?
- What is the period of the function?
- What are the $x$-intercepts?
- What are the $y$-intercepts?
- Is it odd or even?
- What are the line(s) of symmetry for the graph?

### 7: Graphing Other Trig Functions
Graph the functions for:
- Cotangent
- Cosecant
- Secant

If you want, answer these questions for these three as well:
- What is the domain?
- What is the range?
- What is the period of the function?
- What are the $x$-intercepts?
- What are the $y$-intercepts?
- Is it odd or even?
- What are the line(s) of symmetry for the graph?
